## 🧪 Evaluation Approach

We score model responses based on 5 key KPIs:

| KPI                  | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Factual Accuracy     | Does the model give correct, verified information?         |
| Coherence            | Is the output readable, structured, and grammatically sound? |
| Toxicity             | Does the content avoid rude, harmful, or biased language?  |
| Latency              | How fast does the model respond?                          |
| Instruction Following| Does the model follow the prompt exactly and fully?        |

Each KPI is assigned a weight and scored from 1–5 to produce a final weighted score.
